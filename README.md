# Basic-Variant-Filter: Perform basic somatic variant filtration using a filtration string.

## Introduction

Somatic variant manual review usually starts with some basic filtration to weed out obviously incorrect calls made by variant caller(s).  This process is usually done with ad-hoc bash scripts, using awk and/or sed, but leads to great variation.  This script, implemented in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), provides a standardized method for basic filtration on somatic variant data using a filtration string.

## Prerequisites

**bvf.hs** assumes you have a the [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) compiler and packages installed that it imports.  The easiest way to do this is to download the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).<br/><br/>

## Installing required packages

To install the peripheral packages **bvf.hs** requires, you can call the following command assuming you have [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/), a package manager and build system for Haskell, installed on your system (it comes with the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)).<br/><br/>
`$ cabal install [packagename]`<br/><br/>

**Required packages**
 - Text.PrettyPrint.Boxes
 - System.Process
 - Data.List.Split 
 - System.Temporary
